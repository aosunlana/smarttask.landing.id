/**
 * SmartTasker Indonesia — Brevo integration config
 * ==================================================
 * This is the ONLY file to edit when the Brevo account details arrive.
 *
 * RECOMMENDED SETUP (secure):
 *   1. Deploy the proxy in /brevo-proxy/ (see brevo-proxy/README.md — free
 *      Cloudflare Worker; holds the API key server-side as a secret).
 *   2. Paste the deployed proxy URL into PROXY_URL below.
 *   3. Fill in LIST_IDS with the real Brevo list IDs.
 *
 * NEVER put the real Brevo API key in this file or anywhere in this site's
 * JavaScript. Anything in front-end code is publicly readable — a leaked key
 * lets anyone read/delete the entire contact base and send email as the brand.
 * DEV_DIRECT_API_KEY exists ONLY for local testing with a throwaway key and
 * must be empty in production.
