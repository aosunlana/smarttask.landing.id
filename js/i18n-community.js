<p><strong>Leaking Tasks Off Platform</strong></p>
<p>Taking tasks off the SmartTasker platform is not supported. Every Tasker should have a fair go when it comes to submitting an offer and preventing another Tasker's ability to do that creates an unfair environment.</p>
<p>Taking tasks off platform may seem like you are saving money on Tasker Service Fees, however it will lead to your account being cancelled and thus you will lose access to a platform that provides you income potential.</p>
<p>Users may cancel tasks as part of attempting to take tasks off the platform. Repeatedly cancelling tasks may result in you gaining a poor star rating and profile review impacting your ability to win work or result in your account being suspended or banned.</p>`,

  /* ── Section 5 — Pricing, Fees and Payouts ─────────────────── */
  /* LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED: Australian-law reference — fee amounts in AUD; Indonesian counsel to localise fee structures, GST references, and Stripe usage under Indonesian payment regulations (OJK/BI) */
  "community.s5.heading": "5. Pricing, Fees and Payouts",
  "community.s5.body": `<p>It's important to understand how pricing and payouts work on SmartTasker.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Offer prices</strong> When you make an offer, it must represent the total amount for that task. Offers must not be hourly, unit or quote based. Partial quotes mentioning further negotiation of prices off the platform are also not permitted.</li>
  <li><strong>No partial payments</strong> Any offers made on your task should be for the full scope of the task. When you accept an offer, that is the final amount that you are obligated to pay (in addition to the Booking Fee). Tasks offering partial payment, including sales and commission-based tasks, are not permitted and will be moderated and/or removed.</li>
  <li><strong>Escrow Account</strong> For safety reasons, cash payments are not supported on the SmartTasker platform. Instead, to ensure that you are paid in full SmartTasker securely holds the task funds received from the poster until you mark the task as complete. Funds are held in escrow by our partner Stripe. This ensures that payouts are held safely and paid out in full at the completion of the Task.</li>
  <li><strong>Accurate banking details</strong> To ensure seamless payment of funds, please ensure your banking details always remain up to date in your Account Settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Cancellation Fee</strong> As set out in the SmartTasker cancellation policy below, if you cancel a task after a Tasker has assigned it to you and are found responsible for that cancellation, you will be charged a Cancellation Fee that will be deducted from your next payment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tasker Service Fees</strong></p>
<p>At SmartTasker we believe in transparency. That is why our fees are readily available and easy to understand. Our Tasker service fees are typically 25% cheaper than our competition.</p>
<p>Our Tasker Service fees are charged at the completion of the task and deducted from the Tasker payment.</p>
<p>Taskers achieve performance tiers based on how many dollars they have earned in the last 30 days. The Service fee depends on the Tier.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Task Starter</strong> are users who have earnt between $0 and $799 in the last 30 days. The service fee for this tier is 2.95% + $2.55 plus GST.</li>
  <li><strong>Task Pro</strong> are users who have earnt between $800 and $2,499 in the last 30 days. The service fee for this tier is 2.95% + $2.55 plus GST.</li>
  <li><strong>Task Expert</strong> are users who have earnt between $2,500 and $4,999 in the last 30 days. The service fee for this tier is 2.95% + $2.55 plus GST.</li>
  <li><strong>Task Master</strong> are users who have earnt over $5,000 in the last 30 days. The service fee for this tier is 1.95% + $2.55 plus GST.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Poster Fees</strong></p>
<p><strong>Booking Fee</strong> SmartTasker charges a $0 Booking fee to posters for the creation and listing of Tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Milestone Transaction Fee</strong> SmartTasker charges a small transaction fee to process and manage milestone payments. This transaction fee is charged on the second Milestone payment and then on all subsequent Milestone payments for that task. The fee is calculated as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2% of the Milestone cost plus GST</li>
  <li>Example: Poster accepts a Task offer of $5,000 and elects to pay via 2 Milestone payments. The first Milestone payment is Milestone cost $2,500 + Booking fee $25 + GST. For the second Milestone payment the cost is Milestone cost $2,500 + 2% transaction fee of $50 + GST.</li>

  /* ── Section 6 — Cancellation Policy ───────────────────────── */
  /* LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED: Australian-law reference — cancellation fee structure and escrow provider (Stripe) usage; Indonesian counsel to confirm compliance with OJK/Bank Indonesia regulations and applicable consumer protection law */
  "community.s6.heading": "6. SmartTasker Cancellation Policy",
  "community.s6.body": `<p>At SmartTasker, we want to maintain a consistent and reliable marketplace for all Posters and Taskers.</p>
<p>A clear and fair cancellation policy helps protect both Posters and Taskers and allows us to set clear expectations as to what happens when a task is cancelled.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>When using the SmartTasker platform, we expect each of our valued Posters and Taskers to uphold certain responsibilities. Cancelled tasks may trigger certain fees (see Service and Fees) which are payable depending on who is responsible for the cancellation.</p>
<p><strong>Tasker Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>When using the SmartTasker platform, we expect Taskers to use their expertise and skills to carefully guide Posters through the journey of having a task scoped, agreed, and completed. This journey includes helping Posters understand the involved skill, scope, timing, and price of the task they need completed, alongside completing the task in a professional manner.</p>
<p><strong>Poster Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>When using the SmartTasker platform, we expect Posters will provide Taskers with as much information as possible on the task that you need completed. This includes describing your task with a reasonable amount of detail, providing pictures where they are helpful and answering any questions that your Tasker may have. Ultimately, the more information you give, the more likely that the task will be completed to your expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Services &amp; Fees</strong></p>
<p><strong>Booking Fee</strong> In the event that the Tasker cancels your task, and the Poster is not responsible for the cancellation, the Booking fee will be refunded to the Poster. Processing of your refund to your original payment method can take up to 10 business days to complete.</p>
<p><strong>Milestone Transaction Fee</strong> In the event that the Tasker cancels your task and you have Milestone Payments set up, the Milestone Transaction fee will not be refunded to the Poster. This is a fee retained by our Payments Provider and unable to be refunded.</p>
<p><strong>Cancellation Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Posters</strong></p>
<p>As a Poster, if you choose to cancel a task, you will be refunded the amount of the task that has been cancelled. As noted in the Booking Fee section above, the Booking fee will be non-refundable. You will also be charged a 2% transaction fee.</p>
<p><strong>Tasker</strong></p>
<p>As a Tasker, if you choose to cancel a task, a cancellation fee may be charged equal to the value of the Booking fee paid by the Poster for that relevant task. You will also be charged a 2% transaction fee. This cancellation fee may be automatically deducted from your next payment payout.</p>
<p><strong>Automated cancellations</strong></p>
<p>When a Poster or Tasker submits a request to cancel a task, the request is sent to the other party to approve or reject the cancellation. In the case where an acceptance or rejection is not received by that party within 48 hours from the submitted request, the task will be cancelled automatically, and a party will be held responsible for the cancellation fee based on the information provided through the cancellation request.</p>
<p><strong>Repeated Cancellations</strong></p>
<p>If you repeatedly cancel tasks, your account may be suspended at our sole discretion. Account suspensions can range from temporary suspensions (i.e. 1 week suspension) to permanent suspensions.</p>
<p>Ratings and reviews also provide valuable feedback that can help Posters and Taskers inform their decisions about which person to work with. Posters are able to provide a review on a cancelled task as well as provide feedback to SmartTasker which we may act on at our sole discretion. Cancellations impact your star rating and reliability scores on the marketplace which can reduce your ability to win tasks.</p>`,

Kutipan parsial yang menyebutkan negosiasi harga lebih lanjut di luar platform juga tidak diizinkan.</li>
  <li><strong>Tidak ada pembayaran parsial</strong> Setiap penawaran yang dibuat untuk tugas Anda harus mencakup seluruh lingkup tugas.

Tugas yang menawarkan pembayaran parsial, termasuk tugas berbasis penjualan dan komisi, tidak diizinkan dan akan dimoderasi dan/atau dihapus.</li>
  <li><strong>Rekening Escrow</strong> Demi alasan keamanan, pembayaran tunai tidak didukung di platform SmartTasker. Sebaliknya, untuk memastikan Anda dibayar penuh, SmartTasker menyimpan dana tugas yang diterima dari poster secara aman hingga Anda menandai tugas sebagai selesai. Dana disimpan dalam rekening escrow oleh mitra kami, Stripe. Ini memastikan pembayaran disimpan dengan aman dan dibayarkan penuh saat Tugas selesai.</li>
  <li><strong>Detail perbankan yang akurat</strong> Untuk memastikan kelancaran pembayaran dana, pastikan detail perbankan Anda selalu mutakhir di Pengaturan Akun Anda.</li>
  <li><strong>Biaya Pembatalan</strong> Sebagaimana diatur dalam kebijakan pembatalan SmartTasker di bawah ini, jika Anda membatalkan tugas setelah Tasker menugaskannya kepada Anda dan dinyatakan bertanggung jawab atas pembatalan tersebut, Anda akan dikenakan Biaya Pembatalan yang akan dipotong dari pembayaran berikutnya.</li>

<p>Tasker mencapai tingkat kinerja berdasarkan berapa banyak yang telah mereka peroleh dalam 30 hari terakhir. Biaya layanan tergantung pada Tingkat.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Task Starter</strong> adalah pengguna yang telah memperoleh antara $0 dan $799 dalam 30 hari terakhir. Biaya layanan untuk tingkat ini adalah 2,95% + $2,55 ditambah GST.</li>
  <li><strong>Task Pro</strong> adalah pengguna yang telah memperoleh antara $800 dan $2.499 dalam 30 hari terakhir. Biaya layanan untuk tingkat ini adalah 2,95% + $2,55 ditambah GST.</li>
  <li><strong>Task Expert</strong> adalah pengguna yang telah memperoleh antara $2.500 dan $4.999 dalam 30 hari terakhir. Biaya layanan untuk tingkat ini adalah 2,95% + $2,55 ditambah GST.</li>
  <li><strong>Task Master</strong> adalah pengguna yang telah memperoleh lebih dari $5.000 dalam 30 hari terakhir. Biaya layanan untuk tingkat ini adalah 1,95% + $2,55 ditambah GST.</li>

<p><strong>Biaya Poster</strong></p>
<p><strong>Biaya Pemesanan</strong> SmartTasker mengenakan Biaya Pemesanan $0 kepada poster untuk pembuatan dan pendaftaran Tugas.</p>

Perjalanan ini termasuk membantu Poster memahami keterampilan, ruang lingkup, waktu, dan harga tugas yang perlu diselesaikan, sekaligus menyelesaikan tugas secara profesional.</p>
<p><strong>Tanggung Jawab Poster</strong></p>
<p>Ketika menggunakan platform SmartTasker, kami mengharapkan Poster akan memberikan Tasker informasi sebanyak mungkin tentang tugas yang perlu Anda selesaikan. Ini termasuk mendeskripsikan tugas Anda dengan cukup detail, menyediakan gambar di mana itu membantu, dan menjawab pertanyaan apa pun yang mungkin dimiliki Tasker Anda. Pada akhirnya, semakin banyak informasi yang Anda berikan, semakin besar kemungkinan tugas akan diselesaikan sesuai harapan Anda.</p>
<p><strong>Layanan &amp; Biaya</strong></p>
<p><strong>Biaya Pemesanan</strong> Dalam hal Tasker membatalkan tugas Anda, dan Poster tidak bertanggung jawab atas pembatalan tersebut, Biaya Pemesanan akan dikembalikan kepada Poster. Pemrosesan pengembalian dana ke metode pembayaran asli Anda dapat memakan waktu hingga 10 hari kerja untuk diselesaikan.</p>
<p><strong>Biaya Transaksi Milestone</strong> Dalam hal Tasker membatalkan tugas Anda dan Anda telah menyiapkan Pembayaran Milestone, Biaya Transaksi Milestone tidak akan dikembalikan kepada Poster. Ini adalah biaya yang ditahan oleh Penyedia Pembayaran kami dan tidak dapat dikembalikan.</p>
<p><strong>Kebijakan Pembatalan</strong></p>
<p><strong>Poster</strong></p>
<p>Sebagai Poster, jika Anda memilih untuk membatalkan tugas, Anda akan mendapatkan pengembalian dana sebesar jumlah tugas yang dibatalkan. Sebagaimana dicatat dalam bagian Biaya Pemesanan di atas, Biaya Pemesanan tidak dapat dikembalikan. Anda juga akan dikenakan biaya transaksi 2%.</p>
<p><strong>Tasker</strong></p>
<p>Sebagai Tasker, jika Anda memilih untuk membatalkan tugas, biaya pembatalan dapat dikenakan sebesar nilai Biaya Pemesanan yang dibayarkan oleh Poster untuk tugas yang bersangkutan. Anda juga akan dikenakan biaya transaksi 2%. Biaya pembatalan ini dapat secara otomatis dipotong dari pembayaran berikutnya.</p>
<p><strong>Pembatalan otomatis</strong></p>
<p>Ketika Poster atau Tasker mengajukan permintaan untuk membatalkan tugas, permintaan tersebut dikirim ke pihak lain untuk disetujui atau ditolak. Dalam hal penerimaan atau penolakan tidak diterima oleh pihak tersebut dalam 48 jam sejak permintaan diajukan, tugas akan dibatalkan secara otomatis, dan suatu pihak akan bertanggung jawab atas biaya pembatalan berdasarkan informasi yang diberikan melalui permintaan pembatalan.</p>
<p><strong>Pembatalan Berulang</strong></p>
<p>Jika Anda berulang kali membatalkan tugas, akun Anda dapat ditangguhkan atas kebijaksanaan tunggal kami. Penangguhan akun dapat berkisar dari penangguhan sementara (misalnya penangguhan 1 minggu) hingga penangguhan permanen.</p>
<p>Penilaian dan ulasan juga memberikan umpan balik berharga yang dapat membantu Poster dan Tasker dalam membuat keputusan tentang siapa yang akan bekerja sama. Poster dapat memberikan ulasan pada tugas yang dibatalkan sekaligus memberikan umpan balik kepada SmartTasker yang dapat kami tindaklanjuti atas kebijaksanaan tunggal kami. Pembatalan berdampak pada skor bintang dan skor keandalan Anda di marketplace yang dapat mengurangi kemampuan Anda memenangkan tugas.</p>`,
